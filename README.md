## How to contribute

Contributions are welcome!

Fork this repo.

Create a new directory inside `flet_contrib` for your control(s) - that will be control's module name, for example `flet_contrib.my_control`.

Control directory structure:

* `README.md` - control description, usage, examples, support information.
* `/src` - control implementation.
* `/media` - images, multimedia files, databases and other files required by control to function or used in `README.md`.
* `/examples` - one or more examples of usage of your control.
* `__init__.py` - classes and functions exported to users of your control.

See [ColorPicker](flet_contrib/color_picker) for folder structure example.

See [FletMap](flet_contrib/flet_map) for folder structure example.
